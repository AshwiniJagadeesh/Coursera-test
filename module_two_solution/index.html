  	  Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, which includes cuisine originating from 
      the diverse regions of China, as well as from Overseas Chinese who have settled in other parts of the world.
      Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many 
      other cuisines in Asia,with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as
      rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, and tofu and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide.

  	<section>
  	Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent.
      Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially
      and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by 
      religion, in particular Hinduism, cultural choices and traditions. The cuisine is also influenced by centuries 
      of Islamic rule, particularly the Mughal rule. Samosas and pilafs are examples.
